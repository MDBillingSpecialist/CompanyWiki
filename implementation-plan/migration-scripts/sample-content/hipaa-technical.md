# HIPAA Technical Safeguards

This document outlines the technical safeguards required for HIPAA compliance in healthcare software systems.

## Access Controls

HIPAA requires implementing technical policies and procedures to allow access only to those persons or software programs that have been granted access rights.

### Required Implementations

1. **Unique User Identification (Required)**: Assign a unique name and/or number for identifying and tracking user identity.
   
   - Each user must have unique credentials
   - Shared accounts are prohibited
   - User IDs must be tracked in all system logs

2. **Emergency Access Procedure (Required)**: Establish procedures for obtaining necessary ePHI during an emergency.
   
   - Document break-glass procedures
   - Track and audit all emergency access
   - Regular testing of emergency access procedures

### Addressable Implementations

1. **Automatic Logoff**: Implement electronic procedures that terminate an electronic session after a predetermined time of inactivity.

2. **Encryption and Decryption**: Implement mechanisms to encrypt and decrypt ePHI.

## Audit Controls

HIPAA requires implementing hardware, software, and/or procedural mechanisms that record and examine activity in information systems that contain or use ePHI.

### Requirements

1. **Activity Logs**: Systems must maintain logs of all user actions including:
   
   - User authentication (successful and failed)
   - Data access, modification, and deletion
   - System configuration changes
   - Security-relevant events

2. **Audit Review**: Regular review of audit logs to identify suspicious activity

3. **Integrity Controls**: Protect audit logs from unauthorized modification or deletion

## Integrity Controls

HIPAA requires implementing policies and procedures to protect ePHI from improper alteration or destruction.

### Requirements

1. **Data Validation**: Mechanisms to verify that ePHI has not been altered or destroyed in an unauthorized manner

2. **Authentication Mechanisms**: Electronic mechanisms to corroborate that ePHI has not been altered

3. **Digital Signatures**: Where appropriate, implement digital signature capabilities

## Transmission Security

HIPAA requires implementing technical security measures to guard against unauthorized access to ePHI that is being transmitted over an electronic communications network.

### Addressable Implementations

1. **Integrity Controls**: Security measures to ensure that electronically transmitted ePHI is not improperly modified

2. **Encryption**: Encrypt ePHI whenever deemed appropriate

## Best Practices for Implementation

- Conduct regular risk assessments
- Document all technical safeguard implementations
- Implement defense in depth
- Train staff on security policies and procedures
- Test security controls regularly
- Keep systems patched and updated
