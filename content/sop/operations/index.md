# Operations Standard Operating Procedures

## Overview

These standard operating procedures (SOPs) cover day-to-day business operations and administrative functions. They ensure consistency, efficiency, and quality in our operational activities.

All team members involved in operational activities should follow these procedures to maintain high standards of service delivery and business continuity.

## Operations Principles

Our operations SOPs are guided by the following principles:

1. **Efficiency**: Streamline processes to minimize waste and maximize productivity
2. **Scalability**: Design processes that can grow with the organization
3. **Measurability**: Establish clear metrics to evaluate operational performance
4. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review and refine operational procedures
5. **Compliance**: Ensure all operations adhere to relevant regulations and policies

## Key Operational Metrics

We track the following metrics to evaluate operational effectiveness:

- Employee onboarding completion time
- Support ticket resolution time
- Vendor performance ratings
- System uptime and availability
- Operational cost efficiency

## Operational Roles and Responsibilities

- **Operations Director**: Overall responsibility for operational excellence
- **HR Manager**: Oversees employee onboarding and HR processes
- **Vendor Manager**: Manages vendor relationships and performance
- **Support Team Lead**: Ensures effective support ticket handling
- **Business Continuity Coordinator**: Maintains and tests continuity plans

## Creating New Operations SOPs

To propose a new operations SOP:

1. Identify the operational process that needs standardization
2. Document the current process and identify improvement opportunities
3. Draft the procedure using the SOP template
4. Review with relevant stakeholders
5. Submit for approval to the Operations Director
6. Once approved, add to the wiki and announce to the team

For questions about operations SOPs, contact the Operations Director or relevant team lead.
