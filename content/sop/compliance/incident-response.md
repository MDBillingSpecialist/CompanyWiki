# Incident Response

## Purpose

This procedure establishes a standardized process for responding to security and privacy incidents to minimize impact, ensure proper handling, and meet regulatory requirements, with specific focus on BAA-protected services.

## Scope

This SOP applies to all security and privacy incidents affecting the organization's systems, data, and operations. It covers incident identification, classification, containment, eradication, recovery, and post-incident activities.

## Responsibilities

- **Project Manager/Developer (Austin)**:
  - Leads incident response efforts
  - Coordinates activities
  - Assesses privacy impact and regulatory requirements
  - Provides technical response and forensic analysis
  - Advises on legal implications and notification requirements
  - Manages internal and external communications
  - Maintains technical documentation
  - Documents incident response procedures
- **Lead Developer (Alex)**:
  - Assists with technical response
  - Supports forensic analysis
  - Implements technical solutions
  - Documents technical findings
- **Junior Developer**:
  - Assists with assigned tasks
  - Reports security concerns
  - Follows established procedures
  - Documents assigned tasks
- **HR**:
  - Maintains personnel-related documentation
  - Handles policy acknowledgments
  - Manages access control documentation

## Procedure

### 1. Incident Detection and Reporting
   - Monitor security systems for potential incidents
   - Establish multiple reporting channels:
     * Email: security@company.com
     * Phone: Internal Security Hotline
   - Document initial incident information:
     * Date and time of detection
     * Reporting individual's contact information
     * Systems, data, or personnel affected
     * Description of the incident
   - Notify Austin within 1 hour of detection

### 2. Incident Classification
   - Assess incident severity based on:
     * **Critical**: Significant data breach, system compromise with business impact
     * **High**: Limited data exposure, targeted attack, moderate business impact
     * **Medium**: Attempted breach, minor system compromise, limited business impact
     * **Low**: Policy violation, isolated security event, minimal business impact
   - Determine incident category:
     * Data Breach
     * Malware/Ransomware
     * Phishing/Social Engineering
     * Unauthorized Access
     * Denial of Service
     * Physical Security
     * Insider Threat
   - Document classification in incident response system

### 3. Incident Response Team Activation
   - For Critical/High incidents:
     * Activate full team (Austin, Alex)
     * Establish communication channel
     * Schedule regular status updates
   - For Medium/Low incidents:
     * Assign appropriate personnel
     * Establish communication schedule
   - Notify executive leadership based on severity

### 4. Containment
   - Implement immediate containment measures:
     * Isolate affected systems
     * Block malicious IP addresses/domains
     * Disable compromised accounts
     * Preserve evidence
   - Document all containment actions taken
   - Assess containment effectiveness
   - Implement additional measures as needed

### 5. Eradication
   - Remove malicious code, unauthorized access, and security vulnerabilities
   - Conduct forensic analysis to identify root cause
   - Verify all malicious components have been removed
   - Document eradication procedures
   - Perform security scans to confirm eradication

### 6. Recovery
   - Restore systems from clean backups when necessary
   - Reset credentials for affected accounts
   - Implement additional security controls
   - Verify system functionality
   - Monitor systems for signs of persistent threats
   - Return systems to production gradually

### 7. Notification and Reporting
   - Determine notification requirements:
     * Internal stakeholders
     * Affected individuals
     * Regulatory authorities
     * Law enforcement
     * Business partners
   - Prepare notification content
   - Follow regulatory timeframes for notification:
     * HIPAA: 60 days from discovery
     * State laws: Varies by jurisdiction
   - Document all notification activities

### 8. Post-Incident Activities
   - Conduct post-incident review within 2 weeks
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update security controls and procedures
   - Provide additional training if needed
   - Update incident response plan based on findings
   - Present summary report to executive leadership

## Incident Severity Matrix

| Severity | Impact | Response Time | Notification | Example |
|----------|--------|---------------|--------------|---------|
| Critical | Significant business impact, regulatory concerns | Immediate | Executive team | PHI/PII breach affecting >500 individuals |
| High | Moderate business impact, potential regulatory issues | 1 hour | Executive team | Ransomware affecting non-critical systems |
| Medium | Limited business impact | 4 hours | Department heads | Compromised employee account |
| Low | Minimal impact | 24 hours | Team leads | Isolated policy violation |

## Regulatory Reporting Requirements

| Regulation | Reporting Timeframe | Reporting Authority | Documentation Required |
|------------|---------------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| HIPAA | 60 days from discovery | HHS OCR | Breach notification letter, affected individuals, remediation plan |
| State Laws | Varies (30-90 days) | State Attorney General | Varies by state |
