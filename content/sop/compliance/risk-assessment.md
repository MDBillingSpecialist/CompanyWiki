# Risk Assessment

## Purpose

This procedure establishes a standardized process for conducting security and privacy risk assessments to identify, evaluate, and mitigate risks to the organization's systems and data, with specific focus on BAA-protected services.

## Scope

This SOP applies to all systems, applications, and processes that handle or process protected information. It covers risk identification, analysis, evaluation, and treatment planning.

## Responsibilities

- **Project Manager/Developer (Austin)**:
  - Leads risk assessment process
  - Coordinates assessment activities
  - Conducts technical risk analysis
  - Evaluates security controls
  - Documents risk assessment findings
  - Maintains risk register
  - Implements risk treatment plans
  - Reports to executive leadership
- **Lead Developer (Alex)**:
  - Assists with technical risk analysis
  - Evaluates system vulnerabilities
  - Implements security controls
  - Documents technical findings
- **Junior Developer**:
  - Assists with assigned tasks
  - Reports potential risks
  - Follows established procedures
  - Documents assigned tasks
- **HR**:
  - Maintains personnel-related documentation
  - Handles policy acknowledgments
  - Manages access control documentation

## Procedure

### 1. Risk Assessment Planning
   - Define assessment scope and objectives
   - Identify assessment team members
   - Schedule assessment activities
   - Gather relevant documentation:
     * System architecture diagrams
     * Data flow diagrams
     * Security control documentation
     * Previous assessment reports
   - Document assessment plan

### 2. Risk Identification
   - Identify assets and their value
   - Identify threats and vulnerabilities
   - Identify existing controls
   - Document risk scenarios
   - Focus on BAA-protected services and data
   - Consider:
     * Technical vulnerabilities
     * Process weaknesses
     * Human factors
     * External threats
     * Environmental factors

### 3. Risk Analysis
   - Assess likelihood of occurrence
   - Assess potential impact
   - Calculate risk level:
     * High: Significant impact, likely occurrence
     * Medium: Moderate impact, possible occurrence
     * Low: Minor impact, unlikely occurrence
   - Document analysis methodology
   - Consider:
     * Data sensitivity
     * System criticality
     * Regulatory requirements
     * Business impact

### 4. Risk Evaluation
   - Compare risk levels to risk criteria
   - Prioritize risks for treatment
   - Document evaluation results
   - Consider:
     * Risk tolerance
     * Resource availability
     * Regulatory requirements
     * Business objectives

### 5. Risk Treatment
   - Develop treatment options:
     * Risk avoidance
     * Risk reduction
     * Risk transfer
     * Risk acceptance
   - Select appropriate treatments
   - Develop implementation plan
   - Assign responsibilities
   - Set timelines
   - Document treatment decisions

### 6. Risk Monitoring and Review
   - Establish monitoring procedures
   - Schedule regular reviews
   - Update risk register
   - Report on risk status
   - Document changes in risk profile

## Risk Assessment Matrix

| Impact | Likelihood | Risk Level | Action Required |
|--------|------------|------------|-----------------|
| High | High | Critical | Immediate action required |
| High | Medium | High | Action required within 30 days |
| High | Low | Medium | Action required within 90 days |
| Medium | High | High | Action required within 30 days |
| Medium | Medium | Medium | Action required within 90 days |
| Medium | Low | Low | Monitor and review |
| Low | High | Medium | Action required within 90 days |
| Low | Medium | Low | Monitor and review |
| Low | Low | Low | Accept and monitor |

## Risk Treatment Options

| Treatment | Description | Example |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Avoid | Eliminate the risk | Discontinue use of vulnerable system |
| Reduce | Implement controls | Add encryption, access controls |
| Transfer | Share the risk | Purchase insurance, use BAA-protected services |
| Accept | Acknowledge the risk | Document and monitor low-risk items |
