# Engineering Standard Operating Procedures

## Overview

These standard operating procedures (SOPs) govern our software development, deployment, and maintenance processes. They ensure consistency, quality, and reliability across all engineering activities.

All engineering team members are expected to follow these procedures to maintain high standards of code quality, system reliability, and operational excellence.

## Available Procedures

| Procedure | Description | Last Updated |
|-----------|-------------|--------------|
| [Deployment Process](/wiki/sop/engineering/deployment) | Step-by-step guide for deploying applications to production | March 13, 2025 |
| [Code Review Standards](/wiki/sop/engineering/code-review) | Requirements and best practices for code reviews | March 13, 2025 |
| [Incident Management](/wiki/sop/engineering/incident-management) | Procedures for handling production incidents | March 13, 2025 |
| [Testing Protocols](/wiki/sop/engineering/testing-protocols) | Guidelines for unit, integration, and acceptance testing | March 13, 2025 |
| [Database Management](/wiki/sop/engineering/database-management) | Procedures for database operations and maintenance | March 13, 2025 |

## Engineering SOP Principles

Our engineering SOPs are guided by the following principles:

1. **Automation First**: Automate repetitive tasks to reduce human error and increase efficiency
2. **Consistency**: Follow the same processes across all projects and teams
3. **Documentation**: Document all procedures, decisions, and configurations
4. **Testing**: Test thoroughly at all levels (unit, integration, system)
5. **Security**: Incorporate security considerations at every stage
6. **Continuous Improvement**: Regularly review and update procedures based on feedback and lessons learned

## Creating New Engineering SOPs

To propose a new engineering SOP:

1. Identify the need for standardization in a specific area
2. Draft the procedure using the SOP template
3. Review with relevant engineering teams
4. Submit for approval to the Engineering Director
5. Once approved, add to the wiki and announce to the engineering team

## Compliance Requirements

All engineering SOPs must comply with:

- Company security policies
- HIPAA requirements (where applicable)
- Industry best practices
- Regulatory requirements for our industry

For questions about engineering SOPs, contact the Engineering Director or DevOps Lead.
