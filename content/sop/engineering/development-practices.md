# Development Practices

## Purpose

This procedure establishes standardized development practices, coding standards, and deployment procedures to ensure consistent, high-quality, and HIPAA-compliant software delivery.

  - Ensures compliance with standards
  - Manages AWS infrastructure
  - Handles production deployments
  - Monitors system health
  - Implements security measures
  - Reviews and approves infrastructure changes
  - Oversees compliance monitoring
- **Developers**: 
  - Follow established practices and standards
  - Maintain documentation
  - Perform code reviews
  - Update task status
  - Handle development and staging deployments
  - Monitor development environments
  - Implement security measures in code
  - Document infrastructure changes
  - Assist with production deployments
  - Report system issues
- **Compliance Officer**: 
  - Ensures HIPAA compliance
  - Reviews security measures
  - Conducts compliance audits
  - Updates compliance documentation

## Development Environment

### Code Editors
- **Primary Options**:
  - VS Code
    - Recommended extensions:
      - ESLint
      - Prettier
      - GitLens
      - Docker
      - AWS Toolkit
  - Cursor
    - Built-in AI assistance
    - Git integration
    - Code navigation
- **Required Extensions**:
  - Cline (AI-assisted coding)
  - Dev Containers
  - ESLint
  - Prettier
  - GitLens
  - AWS Toolkit

### AI Development Assistance
- **Non-PHI Development**:
  - Use Anthropic models for:
    - Code suggestions
    - Documentation generation
    - Code review assistance
    - Bug fixing
    - Performance optimization
  - Document AI usage in commit messages
  - Review AI-generated code thoroughly
- **PHI-Related Development**:
  - Use BAA-protected models only
  - Document all AI-assisted code changes
  - Review for HIPAA compliance
  - Log all PHI-related operations
  - Implement additional security measures

## Coding Standards

### TypeScript
- Enable `strict: true` in tsconfig.json
- Use explicit types
- Avoid `any` type
- Follow interface-first approach
- Use type guards for runtime type checking
- Document complex types and interfaces
- Use generics for reusable components
- Implement proper error types
- Use discriminated unions for state management
- Follow SOLID principles

### File Organization
- Keep files under 500 lines
- One class/component per file
- Clear file naming conventions:
  - PascalCase for components
  - camelCase for utilities
  - kebab-case for files
- Proper directory structure:
  ```
  src/
  ├── components/
  ├── services/
  ├── utils/
  ├── types/
  └── config/
  ```
- Document file purpose in header
- Include version and last modified date

### Code Style
- Follow ESLint and Prettier configurations
- Use meaningful variable names
- Write self-documenting code
- Add JSDoc comments for public APIs
- Maintain consistent formatting
- Use descriptive function names
- Follow single responsibility principle
- Keep functions small and focused
- Use meaningful comments

### Error Handling
- Use try-catch blocks appropriately
- Implement proper error logging
- Create custom error classes
- Handle edge cases explicitly
- Document error scenarios
- Use error boundaries in React
- Implement proper error recovery
- Log errors with context
- Monitor error rates

## Development Workflow

### Git Practices
- Create feature branches for all changes

- Write clear commit messages
- Keep commits atomic
- Regular rebasing with main
- Follow branch naming conventions

### Code Review Process
1. Create pull request
2. Add reviewers
3. Address feedback
4. Pass automated checks:
   - TypeScript compilation
   - ESLint validation
   - Test coverage
   - Build verification
5. Get Technical Lead approval
6. Merge to main
7. Update documentation

### Testing Requirements
- Unit tests for all new code
- Integration tests for critical paths
- E2E tests for user flows
- Maintain minimum coverage (80%)
- Document test cases
- HIPAA compliance testing
- Performance testing
- Security testing
- Load testing

## AWS Deployment

### CloudFormation
- Use Infrastructure as Code
- Document all resources
- Follow AWS best practices:
  - Use nested stacks for complex architectures
  - Implement proper IAM roles and policies
  - Use parameter store for sensitive data
  - Implement proper tagging strategy
  - Use CloudFormation macros for reusable patterns
  - Implement proper error handling
  - Use CloudFormation hooks for validation
  - Implement proper rollback strategies
  - Use CloudFormation drift detection
  - Implement proper monitoring
- Maintain separate stacks for:
  - Development
  - Staging
  - Production
- Document deployment process
- Use CloudFormation templates:
  ```yaml
  AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
  Description: 'HIPAA-compliant infrastructure'
  
  Parameters:
    Environment:
      Type: String
      AllowedValues: [dev, staging, prod]
  
  Resources:
    VPC:
      Type: AWS::EC2::VPC
      Properties:
        CidrBlock: !Ref VpcCidr
        EnableDnsHostnames: true
        Tags:
          - Key: Environment
            Value: !Ref Environment
  ```
