# Standard Operating Procedures

## Overview

Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) are documented, step-by-step instructions that describe how to perform a routine activity. SOPs help maintain quality control, ensure compliance with industry regulations, and reduce miscommunication.

This section contains our organization's official SOPs across different departments and functions. All team members should follow these procedures to ensure consistency, quality, and compliance in our operations.

## Why SOPs Matter

Standardized procedures offer several benefits to our organization:

- **Consistency**: Ensures tasks are performed the same way every time
- **Quality Control**: Reduces errors and maintains high standards
- **Training**: Provides clear instructions for new team members
- **Compliance**: Helps meet regulatory and legal requirements
- **Efficiency**: Reduces time spent figuring out processes
- **Knowledge Preservation**: Captures institutional knowledge
