## Key HIPAA Rules

HIPAA consists of several key rules that govern how we handle protected health information:

- **Privacy Rule**: Establishes standards for how PHI can be used and disclosed, and gives patients rights over their health information
- **Security Rule**: Requires covered entities and business associates to implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of ePHI
- **Breach Notification Rule**: Mandates that if unsecured PHI is breached, individuals must be notified and, in significant cases, HHS and media as well
- **HITECH Act**: Strengthened HIPAA enforcement by extending compliance obligations to business associates and increasing penalties

## Protected Health Information (PHI)

Protected Health Information (PHI) is individually identifiable health data that relates to a person's health condition, provision of care, or payment for care – in any form or medium. This includes:

- Medical records and billing information
- Any health-related information that can identify an individual
- Electronic PHI (ePHI) refers to PHI in electronic form (stored or transmitted)

## Business Associate Responsibilities

As a software developer handling PHI, you are considered a Business Associate under HIPAA and must:

- Sign a Business Associate Agreement (BAA) with the covered entity before accessing PHI
- Follow essentially the same rules for safeguarding PHI as covered entities
- Implement all Security Rule safeguards (administrative, technical, physical)
- Ensure PHI is only used or disclosed as permitted by the Privacy Rule
- Report any breaches to the covered entity without delay
