# Technical Security Standards

## Overview

The HIPAA Security Rule requires covered entities and business associates to implement technical safeguards to protect electronic Protected Health Information (ePHI). This page outlines the required security standards for all systems that store, process, or transmit ePHI.

## Encryption Requirements

### Data at Rest

All ePHI stored in databases, file systems, or other storage mediums must be encrypted:

- **Encryption Algorithm**: Use AES-256 encryption (or at minimum AES-128) for all stored data
- **FIPS Validation**: Use FIPS 140-2 validated cryptographic modules
- **Key Management**: Store encryption keys separately from encrypted data with strict access controls
- **Application**: Implement encryption for:
  - Database storage (e.g., Transparent Data Encryption)
  - File storage (e.g., encrypted volumes or files)
  - Backup media
  - Local device storage (full disk encryption)

### Data in Transit

All ePHI transmitted over networks must be secured:

- **Protocol Requirements**: Only use TLS 1.2+ for all web traffic and API communications
- **Certificate Management**: Implement proper certificate validation to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks
- **VPN Usage**: For remote access, use encrypted VPN tunnels with strong authentication
- **Email Security**: Never send unencrypted PHI via email; use secure messaging systems

## Audit Logging and Monitoring

### Required Audit Controls

Comprehensive audit logs must be maintained for all systems containing ePHI:

- **User Activities**: Log all access to patient records (views, edits, deletions)
- **Administrative Actions**: Log system configuration changes, user account management
- **Authentication Events**: Log successful and failed login attempts
- **Log Content**: Each log entry must include:
  - Timestamp (synchronized across systems)
  - User ID
  - Action performed
  - Affected record/resource
  - Source IP/location when possible

### Log Protection and Review

Logs containing PHI are themselves considered PHI and must be protected:

- **Immutability**: Logs should be write-once or cryptographically verifiable to prevent tampering
- **Access Control**: Restrict log access to authorized security personnel
- **Retention**: Maintain logs for at least 6 years to comply with HIPAA documentation requirements
- **Regular Review**: Implement procedures to regularly review logs for suspicious activity
- **Automated Alerting**: Configure alerts for unusual patterns (multiple failed logins, bulk record access, etc.)

## Access Control Implementation

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Limit access to ePHI based on job function:

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant minimum access necessary for job functions
- **Role Definition**: Define specific roles with clearly documented access permissions
- **Segregation of Duties**: Ensure critical functions require multiple users
- **Regular Review**: Audit access rights quarterly to ensure they remain appropriate

### User Authentication

Implement strong authentication methods:

- **Unique Identification**: Each user must have a unique identifier; shared accounts are prohibited
- **Password Requirements**:
  - Minimum 12 characters with complexity requirements
  - Regular password rotation or continuous compromise monitoring
- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**: Require MFA for:
  - All remote access
  - Administrator accounts
  - Access to large volumes of ePHI
  - High-risk operations
- **Session Management**:
  - Automatic timeout after 15 minutes of inactivity
  - Secure cookie handling and protection against session hijacking
  - Concurrent session limitations where appropriate

## Network and Communication Security

### Network Segmentation

Isolate systems containing ePHI from general networks:

- **Segmentation**: Place databases and PHI storage in private network segments
- **Firewalls**: Implement firewall rules allowing only necessary traffic
- **DMZ Architecture**: Use DMZ for public-facing components

### Endpoint Protection

Protect all endpoints that may access ePHI:

- **Antimalware**: Deploy and maintain current antivirus/anti-malware solutions
- **Device Encryption**: Require full disk encryption on all endpoints
- **Mobile Device Management**: Use MDM solutions to enforce security policies
- **Patch Management**: Keep all systems updated with security patches

### Secure API Design

When developing or integrating APIs:

- **Authentication**: Require strong authentication for all API endpoints accessing PHI
- **Authorization**: Verify permissions for each operation, not just at login
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all inputs to prevent injection attacks
- **Output Encoding**: Properly encode outputs to prevent XSS and similar vulnerabilities
- **Rate Limiting**: Implement throttling to prevent abuse and data mining

## System Integrity and Protection

### Malware Defenses

Protect systems against malware and unauthorized code:

- **Endpoint Protection**: Deploy comprehensive anti-malware solutions
- **Application Control**: Consider whitelisting technologies to prevent unauthorized executables
- **Email Filtering**: Implement advanced email security to block phishing and malware
- **Web Filtering**: Control web access to prevent drive-by downloads and malicious sites

### Change Management

Manage changes to systems containing ePHI:

- **Formal Procedures**: Document and follow change control procedures
- **Testing**: Test all changes in a non-production environment before deployment
- **Approval Process**: Require security review for significant changes
- **Rollback Plans**: Maintain capability to revert changes if issues arise

### Vulnerability Management

Proactively identify and address security weaknesses:

- **Regular Scanning**: Perform automated vulnerability scans at least monthly
- **Penetration Testing**: Conduct annual penetration tests of critical systems
- **Patch Management**: Establish processes to apply security patches within defined timeframes:
  - Critical vulnerabilities: 7 days
  - High severity: 30 days
  - Medium severity: 90 days
- **Remediation Tracking**: Document and track all identified vulnerabilities to resolution

## Data Integrity and Backup

### Data Validation

Ensure ePHI remains accurate and unaltered:

- **Input Validation**: Implement controls to verify data integrity and accuracy during entry
- **Error Checking**: Use checksums or hashing to detect unauthorized modifications
- **Database Constraints**: Implement appropriate data constraints to prevent invalid entries
- **Version Control**: Maintain history of changes to critical data elements

### Backup and Recovery

Maintain retrievable exact copies of ePHI:

- **Backup Schedule**: Perform regular backups based on data criticality
  - Daily incremental backups
  - Weekly full backups
- **Encryption**: Encrypt all backup media
- **Off-site Storage**: Maintain at least one encrypted backup copy off-site
- **Testing**: Validate backup integrity by performing test restorations quarterly
- **Documentation**: Maintain detailed backup and recovery procedures

## Implementation Checklist
