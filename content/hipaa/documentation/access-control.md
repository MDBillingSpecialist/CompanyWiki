# Access Control and Authentication [MANDATORY]

## Overview
This page outlines the access control and authentication requirements that **must** be implemented to ensure HIPAA compliance for our EHR/CCM software. These controls are essential for preventing unauthorized access to Protected Health Information (PHI).

## Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

### Access Control Implementation [MANDATORY]
- **Standard**: Role-based access control with principle of least privilege
- **Implementation**: Granular permissions based on job function
- **Scope**: All systems containing PHI
- **Verification**: Quarterly access control review

#### Implementation Requirements:
1. Assign unique user accounts to all users (never share accounts)
2. Define roles based on job functions with minimum necessary access
3. Implement access controls at the application and database levels
4. Regularly review and update access rights
5. Promptly disable accounts when no longer needed

#### Compliance Verification:
- [ ] Role definitions documented and approved
- [ ] User-to-role assignments documented and appropriate
- [ ] Access control enforcement verified at all levels
- [ ] Regular access reviews conducted and documented
- [ ] Account termination process tested and verified

### Minimum Necessary Access [MANDATORY]
- **Standard**: Users should have access only to the minimum PHI necessary
- **Implementation**: Granular permissions, data segmentation
- **Scope**: All PHI access
- **Verification**: Monthly access pattern review

#### Implementation Requirements:
1. Segment data access by patient, department, or function as appropriate
2. Implement contextual access controls (e.g., care relationship required)
3. Restrict administrative access to those who absolutely require it
4. Document justification for broad access rights
5. Review access patterns to identify potential over-privileged accounts

#### Compliance Verification:
- [ ] Data segmentation controls verified
- [ ] Contextual access controls tested
- [ ] Administrative access limited and documented
- [ ] Justifications for broad access reviewed
- [ ] Access pattern analysis conducted

## Unique IDs and Strong Authentication

### Unique User Identification [MANDATORY]
- **Standard**: Unique identification of all users
- **Implementation**: Individual user accounts with unique identifiers
- **Scope**: All workforce members accessing PHI
- **Verification**: Monthly user account audit

#### Implementation Requirements:
1. Assign a unique username/ID to each user
2. Never reuse identifiers
3. Link all system activities to the specific user ID
4. Maintain user ID history for audit purposes
5. Prohibit shared or generic accounts for PHI access

#### Compliance Verification:
- [ ] Unique ID assignment process verified
- [ ] Audit logs checked for unique ID tracking
- [ ] User ID history maintained
- [ ] No shared accounts detected
- [ ] User ID management procedures documented

### Strong Authentication [MANDATORY]
- **Standard**: Robust authentication mechanisms
- **Implementation**: Complex passwords, MFA for sensitive access
- **Scope**: All system access
- **Verification**: Monthly authentication control review

#### Implementation Requirements:
1. Enforce strong password policies (complexity, expiration, history)
2. Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for remote access and privileged accounts
3. Secure credential storage (hashing, not plaintext)
4. Implement account lockout after failed attempts
5. Provide secure password reset mechanisms

#### Compliance Verification:
- [ ] Password policy enforcement verified
- [ ] MFA implementation tested
- [ ] Credential storage security verified
- [ ] Account lockout functionality tested
- [ ] Password reset process security verified

## Session Management and Access Policies

### Session Management [MANDATORY]
- **Standard**: Secure session handling
- **Implementation**: Timeouts, secure tokens, encryption
- **Scope**: All user sessions accessing PHI
- **Verification**: Monthly session security review

#### Implementation Requirements:
1. Implement automatic session timeout after period of inactivity (15-30 minutes recommended)
2. Use secure, encrypted session tokens
3. Regenerate session IDs after authentication
4. Terminate sessions completely at logout
5. Implement concurrent session controls if appropriate

#### Compliance Verification:
- [ ] Session timeout functionality verified
- [ ] Session token security verified
- [ ] Session ID regeneration confirmed
- [ ] Logout functionality tested
- [ ] Concurrent session controls verified (if applicable)

### Context-Based Access Controls [RECOMMENDED]
- **Standard**: Additional verification for unusual access
- **Implementation**: Location, device, time-based controls
- **Scope**: High-risk access scenarios
- **Verification**: Quarterly unusual access review

#### Implementation Requirements:
1. Implement controls to detect unusual access patterns (time, location, volume)
2. Require additional verification for access from new devices or locations
3. Consider time-of-day restrictions for administrative access
4. Log and alert on unusual access attempts
5. Implement procedures to review and respond to alerts

#### Compliance Verification:
- [ ] Unusual access detection controls verified
- [ ] Additional verification mechanisms tested
- [ ] Time-of-day restrictions verified (if applicable)
- [ ] Alerting functionality tested
- [ ] Alert response procedures verified

## Audit Logging of Access

### Access Logging [MANDATORY]
- **Standard**: Comprehensive logging of all PHI access
- **Implementation**: Detailed, tamper-evident logs
- **Scope**: All PHI access events
- **Verification**: Monthly log review

#### Implementation Requirements:
1. Log all access to PHI (successful and failed attempts)
2. Include user ID, timestamp, action, and affected records
3. Ensure logs are tamper-evident and protected
4. Synchronize system clocks for accurate timestamps
5. Retain logs for at least 6 years

#### Compliance Verification:
- [ ] Access logging verified for all PHI systems
- [ ] Log content verified to include required elements
- [ ] Log protection measures verified
- [ ] Clock synchronization confirmed
- [ ] Log retention policy implemented and tested

### Access Review [MANDATORY]
- **Standard**: Regular review of access logs
- **Implementation**: Automated and manual reviews
- **Scope**: All PHI access logs
- **Verification**: Monthly review documentation

#### Implementation Requirements:
1. Implement automated monitoring for suspicious access patterns
2. Conduct regular manual reviews of access logs
3. Document all reviews and findings
4. Investigate and document any anomalies
5. Retain review documentation for at least 6 years

#### Compliance Verification:
- [ ] Automated monitoring system verified
- [ ] Manual review process documented
- [ ] Review documentation maintained
- [ ] Anomaly investigation process verified
- [ ] Retention of review documentation confirmed

## Technical Implementation Guidance

### Identity and Access Management (IAM)
- Use established IAM systems or libraries
- Implement server-side permission checks for every request
- Never rely solely on client-side access control
- Default to "no access" unless explicitly granted
- Maintain audit trails of permission changes

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Implement MFA for all remote access
- Require MFA for administrative accounts
- Consider MFA for all PHI access
- Use secure MFA methods (authenticator apps, hardware tokens)
- Document any exceptions to MFA requirements

### Session Security
- Use secure, HttpOnly, SameSite cookies
- Implement proper CSRF protections
- Use TLS for all sessions
- Consider IP binding for highly sensitive sessions
- Implement proper session termination
