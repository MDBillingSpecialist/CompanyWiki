# HIPAA Documentation

## Overview

These core requirements represent the fundamental components of HIPAA compliance that every covered entity and business associate must implement. They form the foundation of a comprehensive HIPAA compliance program.

## Technical Security Standards

The [Technical Security Standards](/wiki/hipaa/documentation/technical-security) define the security measures that must be implemented to protect electronic protected health information (ePHI). These standards include:

- Access Controls
- Audit Controls
- Integrity Controls
- Transmission Security
- Risk Management
- Authentication
- Physical Safeguards

## Administrative Requirements

Administrative requirements define the policies, procedures, and organizational structures needed to manage the security and privacy of PHI:

- Security Management Process
- Assigned Security Responsibility
- Workforce Security
- Information Access Management
- Security Awareness and Training
- Security Incident Procedures
- Contingency Planning
- Evaluation
- Business Associate Contracts

## Key Components of HIPAA Compliance

HIPAA compliance is built on several key components:

### Privacy Rule
The Privacy Rule establishes standards for the protection of PHI and defines patients' rights regarding their health information, including:

- Right to access their health information
- Right to request corrections to their health information
- Right to know how their information is being used and shared
- Right to request restrictions on certain uses and disclosures

### Security Rule
The Security Rule complements the Privacy Rule by focusing specifically on electronic PHI (ePHI) and requiring appropriate administrative, physical, and technical safeguards.

### Breach Notification Rule
The Breach Notification Rule requires covered entities to notify affected individuals, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), and in some cases, the media, following a breach of unsecured PHI.

### Enforcement Rule
The Enforcement Rule provides standards for investigations, penalties for HIPAA violations, and procedures for hearings.

## Getting Started with Compliance

To implement HIPAA compliance effectively:

1. Start with a comprehensive risk assessment
2. Develop policies and procedures
3. Implement administrative, physical, and technical safeguards
4. Train staff on HIPAA requirements
5. Document compliance activities
6. Establish ongoing monitoring and review processes
