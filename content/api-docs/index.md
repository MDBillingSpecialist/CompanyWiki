## Third-Party API Documentation

We also maintain documentation for third-party APIs that are commonly used in our projects:

| API | Description | Link |

| OpenAI API | Documentation for OpenAI's models and responses API | [OpenAI API Documentation](openai-api-documentation.md) |

## Getting Started

To get started with our APIs:

1. Request API credentials from the engineering team
2. Review the authentication documentation
3. Explore the API endpoints and examples
4. Use the provided SDKs or make direct REST calls

## Authentication

All APIs require authentication using JWT tokens. To obtain a token:

```
POST /api/auth/token
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "clientId": "your-client-id",
  "clientSecret": "your-client-secret"
}
```

Include the token in all subsequent requests:

```
Authorization: Bearer your-jwt-token
```

## Common Response Formats

All APIs return responses in the following format:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    // Response data here
  },
  "meta": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 10,
    "total": 100
  }
}
```

Error responses follow this format:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "code": "ERROR_CODE",
    "message": "Human-readable error message",
    "details": {}
  }
}
```

## Rate Limiting

API requests are subject to rate limiting to ensure fair usage:

- 100 requests per minute per client ID
- 1000 requests per hour per client ID

Rate limit headers are included in all responses:

```
X-RateLimit-Limit: 100
X-RateLimit-Remaining: 95
X-RateLimit-Reset: 1617981389
```
