# MCP Tools Dashboard

## Overview

The MCP Tools Dashboard provides a centralized interface for monitoring, managing, and interacting with all Model Context Protocol (MCP) tools used within the company. This dashboard helps administrators and developers track tool usage, diagnose issues, and test new tools.

## Dashboard Features

### Tool Monitoring

The dashboard provides real-time monitoring of all MCP tools:

- **Status**: Current operational status of each tool
- **Usage Metrics**: Request volume, response times, error rates
- **Resource Utilization**: CPU, memory, and network usage
- **Historical Data**: Usage trends and patterns over time

### Configuration Management

Manage MCP tool configurations directly from the dashboard:

- **Tool Settings**: Update tool-specific configuration parameters
- **Environment Variables**: Manage sensitive credentials and settings
- **Auto-Approval Rules**: Configure which operations require explicit approval
- **Access Controls**: Manage which users and systems can access each tool

### Logs and Diagnostics

Access detailed logs and diagnostic information:

- **Request Logs**: Complete history of tool requests and responses
- **Error Logs**: Detailed information about failures and exceptions
- **Audit Trail**: Record of configuration changes and administrative actions
- **Performance Metrics**: Detailed timing and resource usage statistics

### Interactive Testing

Test MCP tools directly from the dashboard:

- **Request Builder**: Construct and send test requests to any tool
- **Response Viewer**: Examine tool responses in detail
- **Batch Testing**: Run multiple tests with different parameters
- **Saved Tests**: Save and reuse common test scenarios

## Dashboard Access

The MCP Tools Dashboard is available at:

- **Development**: [http://localhost:3001/mcp-dashboard](http://localhost:3001/mcp-dashboard)
- **Staging**: [https://staging.example.com/mcp-dashboard](https://staging.example.com/mcp-dashboard)
- **Production**: [https://example.com/mcp-dashboard](https://example.com/mcp-dashboard)

Access requires authentication with appropriate permissions.

## Implementation

The dashboard is implemented as a React application that communicates with the MCP server infrastructure. Key components include:

- **Frontend**: React with Material-UI for the user interface
- **Backend**: Node.js API server for dashboard-specific operations
- **Data Store**: Time-series database for metrics and logs
- **Authentication**: Integration with company SSO system

## Getting Started

To access the dashboard:

1. Ensure you have the necessary permissions (contact IT if needed)
2. Navigate to the appropriate dashboard URL for your environment
3. Log in with your company credentials
4. Select the tools or views you want to monitor

## Adding New Tools to the Dashboard

When developing new MCP tools, ensure they are properly integrated with the dashboard:

1. Implement the standard MCP metrics endpoints
2. Register the tool in the dashboard configuration
3. Define appropriate monitoring thresholds
4. Create any tool-specific dashboard widgets
