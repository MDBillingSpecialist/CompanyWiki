# Hybrid Wiki Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the complete implementation plan for transitioning from our custom Next.js wiki to a hybrid architecture that combines Wiki.js with custom HIPAA-specific features and LLM content generation pipelines.

The implementation has been fully developed and is ready for deployment, offering:

1. **Enhanced Wiki Features** through the Wiki.js platform
2. **Preserved HIPAA Compliance Tools** through custom extensions
3. **LLM Content Generation Pipeline** for automated documentation
4. **Unified API Layer** for seamless integration

## Implementation Status

A complete implementation has been prepared in the `implementation-plan` directory, with all necessary components:

- **Docker Compose Configuration**: Ready to deploy all services
- **API Integration Layer**: Fully implemented with authentication
- **HIPAA Extensions**: Built with compliance dashboard and checklists
- **LLM Pipeline**: Implemented with OpenAI/Anthropic integration
- **Migration Scripts**: Ready to transfer content from our current wiki

## Architecture Overview

![Architecture Diagram](implementation-plan/architecture-diagram.txt)

The architecture consists of four main components:

1. **Wiki.js Core**: Provides content management, user authentication, and basic wiki features
2. **API Integration Layer**: Unified API gateway for all services
3. **HIPAA Extensions**: Specialized components for compliance tracking
4. **LLM Content Pipeline**: Automated content generation

All components are containerized for easy deployment and scaling.

## Deployment Process

The deployment process is straightforward:

1. Run the setup script in the implementation-plan directory
2. Complete Wiki.js initial setup via web interface
3. Run migration scripts to import existing content
4. Load sample HIPAA data for testing

Detailed instructions are provided in the implementation README.

## LLM Pipeline Integration

The LLM content pipeline provides:

- Content intake API for document/idea processing
- Integration with OpenAI and Anthropic models
- Draft management and review workflow
- Direct publishing to Wiki.js with appropriate metadata

This enables your goal of having an LLM pipeline "that will take an idea or document, make it real, and send it to the wiki."

## Next Steps

1. Review the implementation plan in the `implementation-plan` directory
2. Schedule a test deployment in a development environment
3. Perform content migration testing with sample data
4. Plan production deployment timeline

## Resources and Documentation

All resources and documentation are available in the implementation plan:

- `implementation-plan/README.md`: Main documentation
- `implementation-plan/api-docs.md`: API documentation
- Individual READMEs in each service directory

## Conclusion

This implementation offers a robust solution that meets all the stated requirements:
- Maintains HIPAA compliance functionality
- Provides enhanced wiki features
- Enables automated content generation
- Ensures seamless migration of existing content

The hybrid architecture gives you the best of both worlds: a professional wiki platform combined with your specialized compliance features and LLM content generation capabilities.
