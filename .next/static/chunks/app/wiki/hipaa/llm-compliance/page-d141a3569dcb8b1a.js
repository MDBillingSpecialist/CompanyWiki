This document provides comprehensive guidance on implementing LLMs in healthcare settings while maintaining HIPAA compliance.\n\n## Regulatory Compliance & Legal Requirements\n\n### HIPAA Rules Applicable to LLMs\n\nWhen implementing LLMs in healthcare, you must comply with all relevant HIPAA regulations:\n\n- **Privacy Rule**: Governs how Protected Health Information (PHI) can be used or disclosed\n- **Security Rule**: Mandates safeguards to protect electronic PHI (ePHI)\n- **Breach Notification Rule**: Requires notifying affected parties if PHI is compromised\n- **HITECH Act**: Strengthened HIPAA enforcement and introduced incentives/penalties related to PHI security\n\n### HIPAA Privacy Rule (Use/Disclosure of PHI)\n\nBefore using PHI with an LLM, determine if the use is permitted under HIPAA\'s Privacy Rule:\n\n- PHI use is generally allowed without patient authorization only for Treatment, Payment, or Healthcare Operations (TPO), or certain public interest exceptions\n- Using PHI to directly care for patients (treatment) or for care coordination and quality improvement (operations) can be permissible without additional consent\n- If PHI will be used to train or develop an AI model, it may not fall under TPO and could be considered a secondary use (or "research")\n- In such cases, patient authorization (consent) is usually required unless the data is fully de-identified\n\n### Business Associate Agreements (BAAs)\n\nDetermine if your LLM or its provider is a Business Associate under HIPAA:\n\n- A Business Associate is any person or entity that "creates, receives, maintains, or transmits" PHI on behalf of a covered entity\n- If you are using a third-party LLM service or API that involves PHI, that service qualifies as a Business Associate\n- Cloud service providers hosting ePHI – even if only storing encrypted PHI and lacking the decryption key – are considered Business Associates\n- Before integrating any external LLM, execute a HIPAA-compliant BAA with the vendor\n- If a vendor will not sign a BAA, do not use real PHI with that service\n\n## PHI Handling and Data Anonymization\n\n### De-identify PHI Whenever Possible\n\nThe best way to protect patient privacy when using LLMs is to remove identifying information:\n\n- De-identified data is not subject to HIPAA regulations\n- HIPAA provides two accepted methods for de-identification:\n  1. **Safe Harbor method**: Remove 18 types of identifiers and any other information that could identify the individual or their relatives/household\n  2. **Expert Determination method**: A qualified expert uses statistical methods to conclude that the risk of re-identifying individuals is very small\n\n### Approved Anonymization Techniques\n\nFollow HHS guidance for de-identification:\n\n- **Removal or Masking of Identifiers**: Strip out personal data like names, phone numbers, emails, medical record numbers, device identifiers, biometric identifiers, photographs, etc.\n- **Aggregation and Generalization**: Use ranges or categories instead of specific values\n- **Data Masking/Pseudonymization**: Mask data fields needed for context so that the model still gets structured input without real PHI\n- **Expert Statistical De-identification**: Apply k-anonymity, l-diversity, differential privacy, or other techniques to ensure that combinations of health data cannot single out a person\n'}})]});return(0,n.jsx)(a.F,{children:(0,n.jsx)("article",{className:"prose prose-slate dark:prose-invert max-w-none",children:e})})}},6368:(e,t,i)=>{Promise.resolve().then(i.bind(i,4263))}},e=>{var t=t=>e(e.s=t);e.O(0,[888,462,441,684,358],()=>t(6368)),_N_E=e.O()}]);
